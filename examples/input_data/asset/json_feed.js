It\u2019s a surprisingly fun way to pass the time and incentivise their imagination by saying you\u2019ll send the best story off to a publisher.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cspan class=\u0022Apple-tab-span\u0022\u003E \u003C\/span\u003EAdd a competitive element. Whether it\u2019s \u2018who can tell me the best fact about where we\u2019re going\u2019 or car colour bingo (where the first person to count 10 cars of their chosen colour wins), make the prize the choice of what to play next on the mp3 player or the choice of bedroom when you arrive and you\u2019ll be amazed how much effort they\u2019ll put in.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd mix it up. If they\u2019ve been quiet for an hour playing with a tablet or reading and you can feel them getting fidgety, mix it up with something completely different \u2013 such as a singalong to divide the journey into specific activity chunks.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Props\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs with most things parenting-related, being organised is essential. You can kill a good few hours simply by having the right props to work with.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDepending on what you have available to you, you will need some configuration of the following items:\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA tablet with pre-loaded apps, an in car DVD player, audiobooks and singalong tapes, pens and paper for keeping score or writing down your stories. And whatever you do, do not forget an in-car for any electronic device you bring.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAudio books are available from Audible or iTunes or buy a CD version for the car stereo for when your storytelling abilities wane.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Picnic\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOn long journey\u2019s it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll have to stop for refreshments. Buying for the whole family at a service station can really add up, so make a picnic the night before and work 45 minutes or an hour into your schedule so everyone can have a real break and let off steam (including the poor driver).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can find a picnic spot that will allow the kids to run around, so much the better, though these are more common on the Continent than in the UK.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to food, go for a healthy balanced range for the picnic and avoid fizzy drinks and sweets as these will give everyone a sugar and E-number rush that will make the proceeding few hours a nightmare all round.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EDishes such as brown bread sandwiches and wholewheat pasta salads have a low GI giving slow-release energy rather than a sugar high and crash. If you know they\u2019ll want something sweet for afters stick to fruits for pudding \u2013 but eat them whole rather than mashing them into a sugary smoothie or juice.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might be tempting to stock up on sweets and chocolates for the car journey but as well as worsening car sickness, they\u2019ll give them too quick a hit of energy. Instead, cucumber and carrot crudit\u00e9s with hummus are good for snacks or if forcing vegetables down is to hard, popcorn is ideal.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor drinks stick to water or watered down fruit juice.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnjoy The Journey\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can sounds cheesy and a bit impossible at times, but if you can make the journey as much fun as you can for everyone then it will seem shorter and future trips won\u2019t take on an air of an ordeal.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGood luck!\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E",
